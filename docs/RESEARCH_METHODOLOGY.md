# Research Methodology

SFM-2 is built from the ground up with a focus on understanding and generating programming languages. This document summarizes the methodology used during research and development.

## Objectives

- Develop syntax-aware attention mechanisms tailored for source code
- Evaluate model performance across multiple programming tasks
- Provide a production-ready API with intelligent fallback systems
- Maintain a reproducible training and validation pipeline

## Approach

1. **Syntax-aware Model Design**
   - Utilize Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to guide attention patterns
   - Incorporate token type and scope information into embeddings
2. **Systematic Evaluation**
   - Functional correctness tests for generated code
   - Syntactic validity and style checks
   - Benchmarks covering completion, explanation and refactoring tasks
3. **API and Fallback Architecture**
   - RESTful API built with FastAPI
   - Automatic fallback chain: SFM-2 → GPT-2 LoRA → OpenAI models
   - Health monitoring and detailed error reporting
4. **Training Pipeline**
   - Configurable datasets and hyperparameters
   - Early stopping and gradient accumulation support
   - Logging and metrics with TensorBoard

## Reproducibility

All experiments are tracked through configuration files under `configs/` and logs produced by the training scripts. Instructions for running the pipeline can be found in the [Training Guide](TRAINING_GUIDE.md).
