> **Advanced language model architecture specifically designed for programming language understanding and code generation**

## 🎯 Overview

SFM-2 (Syntax-aware Foundation Model 2) is a novel transformer architecture that incorporates programming language syntax awareness directly into the attention mechanism. This repository contains the complete training framework, model architecture, and evaluation methodology.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Syntax-aware Attention**: Custom attention mechanisms that understand programming language structure
- **Domain-specific Tokenization**: Advanced tokenization optimized for code representation
- **Multi-modal Training**: Supports natural language instructions and code generation
- **Efficient Fine-tuning**: LoRA and other parameter-efficient training methods

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bryantad/SfM-2.git
cd SfM-2

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic training example
python scripts/setup_environment.py
python src/sfm2/training/pipeline.py --config configs/example_config.json
```
